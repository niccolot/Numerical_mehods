# Numerical_methods

This repo contains little projects concerning Montecarlo simulations of physical system from the statistical point of view and some sparse example/utility programs like bootstrap.c for calculating errors in datapoint with bootstrap algorithm

All the simulations are done in C language implementing a Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm, in particular the Metropolis version

## Ising model

Simulations of the thormofdinamical properties of a 2D ising model with square lattice

## Pathintegral

Simulations of an anharmonic quantum quadratical system via pathintegral formulation in order to exploit the statistical framework it naturally offers in the euclidean setting
