# Numerical_mehods

This repo contains little projects concerning Montecarlo simulations of physical system from the statistical point of view and some sparse example/utility programs like bootstrap.c for calculating errors in datapoint with bootstrap algorithm

## Ising model

Simulations of the thormofdinamical properties of a 2D ising model with square lattice

## Pathintegral

Simulations of an hanarmonic quantum quadratical system via pathintegral formulation in order to exploit the statistical framework it naturally offers in the euclidean formulation
